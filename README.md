## Usage

# Once you have installed and executed the program, you will see the following transformations:

# Prefix Addition:
"happy" -> "unhappy"
"manageable" -> "unmanageable"

# Word Grouping with Prefix:
['en', 'close', 'joy', 'lighten'] -> "en :: enclose :: enjoy :: enlighten"
['pre', 'serve', 'dispose', 'position'] -> "pre :: preserve :: predispose :: preposition"
['auto', 'didactic', 'graph', 'mate'] -> "auto :: autodidactic :: autograph :: automate"
['inter', 'twine', 'connected', 'dependent'] -> "inter :: intertwine :: interconnected :: interdependent"

# Suffix Removal:
"heaviness" -> "heavy"
"sadness" -> "sad"

# Adjective to Verb Transformation:
"I need to make that bright" -> "brighten"
"It got dark as the sun set." -> "darken"

# The program demonstrates these transformations to showcase different word manipulation scenarios.
